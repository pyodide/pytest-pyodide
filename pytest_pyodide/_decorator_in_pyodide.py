"""
This file is not imported normally, it is loaded as a string and then exec'd
into a module called pytest_pyodide.decorator inside of Pyodide.

We use the name `pytest_pyodide.decorator` for this file for two reasons:

1. so that unpickling works smoothly
2. so that importing PyodideHandle works smoothly inside Pyodide

We could handle 1. by subclassing Unpickler and overriding find_class. Then we
could give a different name like `from pytest_pyodide.in_pyodide import
PyodideHandle` or something. But I think this current approach is the easiest
for users to make sense of. It is probably still quite confusing.
